WIP: stm32g0xx-hal
=============

ðŸš§ Work in progress.

_stm32g0xx-hal_ contains a multi device hardware abstraction on top of the
peripheral access API for the STMicro STM32G0 series microcontrollers. The
selection of the MCU is done by feature gates, typically specified by board
support crates.
